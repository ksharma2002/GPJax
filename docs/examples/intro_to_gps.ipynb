    "Fantastic that you're here! This notebook is designed to be a gentle\n",
    "introduction to the mathematics of Gaussian processes (GPs). No prior\n",
    "knowledge of Bayesian inference or GPs is assumed, and this notebook is\n",
    "self-contained. At a high level, we begin by introducing Bayes' theorem and\n",
    "its implications within probabilistic modelling. We then proceed to introduce\n",
    "the Gaussian random variable along with its multivariate form. We conclude by\n",
    "showing how this notion can be extended to GPs.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A probabilistic modelling task is comprised of an observed dataset\n",
    "$\\mathbf{y}$ for which we construct a model. The parameters $\\theta$ of our\n",
    "model are unknown, and our goal is to conduct inference to determine their\n",
    "range of likely values. To achieve this, we apply Bayes' theorem\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\label{eq:BayesTheorem}\n",
    "    p(\\theta\\,|\\, \\mathbf{y}) = \\frac{p(\\theta)p(\\mathbf{y}\\,|\\,\\theta)}{p(\\mathbf{y})} = \\frac{p(\\theta)p(\\mathbf{y}\\,|\\,\\theta)}{\\int_{\\theta}p(\\mathbf{y}, \\theta)\\mathrm{d}\\theta}\\,,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $p(\\mathbf{y}\\,|\\,\\theta)$ denotes the _likelihood_, or model, and\n",
    "quantifies how likely the observed dataset $\\mathbf{y}$ is, given the\n",
    "parameter estimate $\\theta$. The _prior_ distribution $p(\\theta)$ reflects our\n",
    "initial beliefs about the value of $\\theta$ before observing data, whilst the\n",
    "_posterior_ $p(\\theta\\,|\\, \\mathbf{y})$ gives an updated estimate of the\n",
    "parameters' value, after observing $\\mathbf{y}$. The _marginal likelihood_, or\n",
    "Bayesian model evidence, $p(\\mathbf{y})$ is the probability of the observed\n",
    "data under all possible hypotheses that our prior model can generate. Within\n",
    "Bayesian model selection, this property makes the marginal log-likelihood an\n",
    "indispensable tool. Selecting models under this criterion places a higher\n",
    "emphasis on models that can generalise better to new data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the posterior distribution belongs to the same family of probability\n",
    "distributions as the prior, we describe the prior and the likelihood as\n",
    "_conjugate_ to each other. Such a scenario is convenient in Bayesian inference\n",
    "as it allows us to derive closed-form expressions for the posterior\n",
    "distribution. When the likelihood function is a member of the exponential\n",
    "family, then there exists a conjugate prior. However, the conjugate prior may\n",
    "not have a form that precisely reflects the practitioner's belief surrounding\n",
    "the parameter. For this reason, conjugate models seldom appear; one exception\n",
    "to this is GP regression that we present fully in our [Regression notebook](https://docs.jaxgaussianprocesses.com/examples/regression/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For models that do not contain a conjugate prior, the marginal log-likelihood\n",
    "must be calculated to normalise the posterior distribution and ensure it\n",
    "integrates to 1. For models with a single, 1-dimensional parameter, it may be\n",
    "possible to compute this integral analytically or through a quadrature scheme,\n",
    "such as Gauss-Hermite. However, in machine learning, the dimensionality of\n",
    "$\\theta$ is often large and the corresponding integral required to compute\n",
    "$p(\\mathbf{y})$ quickly becomes intractable as the dimension grows. Techniques\n",
    "such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo and variational inference allow us to\n",
    "approximate integrals such as the one seen in $p(\\mathbf{y})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a posterior distribution has been obtained, we can make predictions at\n",
